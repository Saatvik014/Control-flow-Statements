Question 1)Consider the following code snippet.

if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");

a)What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?
Ans a)second string
      third string

b)Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? Is it what 
you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is. In other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?
Ans b)if(3>=0)
         if(3==0)
          System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");

Explaination:-
So according to the code,for the first if statement,condition is true,so we will go to second if statement,the condition now
becomes false because 3 is not equal to 0,so now the else clause will be executed,so the second print statement will be 
printed i.e."second string".Then the final print statement is outside of any if statement, so it will always be executed,
so"third string"will always be displayed.

c)Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand. 
Ans c)if (aNumber >=0)
       if( aNumber ==0)
         System.out.println("first string");
   else
      System.out.println("second string");

     System.out.println("third string");

d) Use braces { and } to further clarify the code and reduce the possibility of errors by future maintainers of the code.
Ans d)if (aNumber >=0)
       {
      if( aNumber ==0)
    {
         System.out.println("first string");
}
   else
{
      System.out.println("second string");
}
}

     System.out.println("third string");
